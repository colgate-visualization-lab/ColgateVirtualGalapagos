      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Colgate Virtual Galapagos, a digital learning module currently in development by students, staff,
        and
        faculty at Colgate University.</p>
      <p>The primary objective of the Virtual Galapagos Project is to construct a digital educational experience for
        children
        around the globe to learn about science through the lens of the Galapagos Islands. Our project differs
        from many existing informal science efforts, in that students encounter concepts from multiple disciplines, with
        an emphasis on geology and evolutionary biology. Most importantly, the Virtual Galapagos resource is designed to
        inspire students to pursue careers in science by leading users toward sophisticated scientific concepts,
        culminating in results from recent research efforts in the Galapagos and highlighting contributions from leading
        Galapagos scientists and conservationists.</p>
      <p>The project blends a set of intersecting storylines that lead users through modules, each focused on
        fundamental
        concepts critical for understanding the development of the Galapagos Archipelago and its unique flora and fauna.
        For instance, students are given the opportunity to explore how the volcanic islands develop and subside, how
        species colonize the islands, the genetic relationship between land and marine iguanas, how currents shape life
        on
        the Galapagos, how adaptive radiation occurs, as illustrated by Galapagos finches. We employ many types of
        interactive mechanisms to engage users intellectually, as well as images and 360&deg video collected last year
        in
        the islands, whiteboard animations, interviews with research scientists, and suggestions for experiments
        students
        can do on their own as complements to the resource’s content. A set of narrators guide the users through the
        experience, while allowing students freedom to select their specific exploration path. </p>
      <p>So far, we have one functional and mostly finished module to serve as a prototype. This module introduces
        students to the basics behind how volcanoes. To see this module, <a href="volcano/Volcano_TerrainMap01.html">
          click here.</a> This is an open source project welcoming contributions, and the source code is available <a
          href="https://github.com/CaioBrighenti/ColgateVirtualGalapagos"> here on GitHub</a>.</p>
      <p>Once this pilot phase of the project is operational, we will begin to incorporate contributions from Galapagos
        naturalist guides and residents, as well, making the outreach project a truly grassroots effort, built by people
        who work and live in the archipelago. </p>
      <p>Because this resource is intended to be accessible to a wide range of audiences, we are collaborating with the
        SolarSPELL team at Arizona State University to host the digital resource on portable, ruggedized, solar-powered
        equipment that can generate a local wireless server that anyone nearby can connect to without needing internet
        connection. Consequently, students lacking reliable Internet access will be able to use both the Virtual
        Galapagos
        resource and a digital library of supporting material. </p>
      <p>The Virtual Galapagos Project is funded through support from NASC, Colgate’s Geology Department, and a
        collaborative grant from the Office of Science and Society at McGill University’s Labs Without Borders. </p>
